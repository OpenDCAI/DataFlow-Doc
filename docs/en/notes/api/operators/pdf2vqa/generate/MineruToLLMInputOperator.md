## 📘 Overview

`MinerU2LLMInputOperator` is a format conversion operator specifically designed for processing **MinerU** parsing results. It transforms the underlying `_content_list.json` files generated by MinerU into a flattened format that is more suitable for Large Language Model (LLM) understanding and processing.

### Key Features:
* **List Flattening**: Breaks down complex `list` type items into individual `text` entries.
* **Data Cleaning**: Removes metadata that is typically unnecessary for LLMs, such as `bbox` (bounding box coordinates) and `page_idx` (page numbers).
* **Re-indexing**: Generates continuous and unique `id` values for all converted content items.

## `__init__` Function

```python
def __init__(self)

```

This operator does not require any additional parameters during initialization.

## `run` Function

```python
def run(self, storage: DataFlowStorage, input_markdown_path_key: str, output_converted_layout_key: str)

```

Executes the conversion logic: Locates the corresponding MinerU JSON file based on the Markdown file path, processes it, saves it as a new file, and records the new path.

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **storage** | DataFlowStorage | Required | DataFlow storage instance. |
| **input_markdown_path_key** | str | Required | Input column name containing the paths to MinerU `.md` files. The operator automatically searches for `_content_list.json` in the same directory. |
| **output_converted_layout_key** | str | Required | Output column name to store the path of the processed `_converted.json` file. |

## 🧠 Conversion Logic Details

1. **Path Matching**: The operator retrieves the file path from `input_markdown_path_key` and replaces the `.md` extension with `_content_list.json` to read the original layout data.
2. **Content Processing**:
* If an entry type is `list` and the sub-type is `text`, the operator iterates through `list_items` and promotes each sub-item to an independent `text` entry.
* Entries that are already `text` or other types are preserved.


3. **Format Simplification**: The `bbox` and `page_idx` fields are removed from all entries to reduce token interference and noise.
4. **File Output**: The resulting file is saved with a `_converted.json` suffix in the same directory as the original file.

## 🧠 Example Usage

#### 🧾 Format Conversion Comparison

**Input (Original MinerU `_content_list.json`):**

```json
[
  {
    "type": "list",
    "sub_type": "text",
    "list_items": ["Item One Content", "Item Two Content"],
    "bbox": [10, 20, 100, 200],
    "page_idx": 0
  }
]

```

**Output (Processed `_converted.json`):**

```json
[
  {
    "type": "text",
    "text": "Item One Content",
    "id": 0
  },
  {
    "type": "text",
    "text": "Item Two Content",
    "id": 1
  }
]

```
