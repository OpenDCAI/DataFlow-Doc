## ðŸ“˜ Overview

The `Text2QAGenerator` is an operator designed to generate Question-Answer (QA) pairs from given text documents. It first generates a specific prompt tailored to the content and then uses that prompt along with the original text to call a Large Language Model (LLM) and produce a relevant question and answer.

## `__init__`
```python
def __init__(self, llm_serving: LLMServingABC)
```

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **llm_serving** | LLMServingABC | Required | A Large Language Model serving instance used for generation. |

```

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
