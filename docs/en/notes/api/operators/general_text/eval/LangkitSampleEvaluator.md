## ðŸ“˜ Overview

`LangkitSampleEvaluator` is a text quality assessment operator that uses the Langkit toolkit to calculate various statistical metrics of text, helping evaluate text structural complexity and readability. This operator can extract multiple linguistic features, including sentence length, lexical diversity, sentiment orientation, etc.

## __init__

```python
def __init__(self)
```

This operator requires no parameters during initialization.

## run

```python
def run(self, storage: DataFlowStorage, input_key: str)
```
Executes the operator's main logic, reading the input DataFrame from storage, performing Langkit evaluation on text in the specified column, and adding evaluation results (multiple scores) as new columns back to the DataFrame and writing to storage.

#### Parameters
| Name | Type | Default | Description |
| :------------- | :---------------- | :---------------- | :----------------- |
| **storage** | DataFlowStorage | Required | DataFlow storage instance for reading and writing data. |
| **input_key** | str | Required | Input column name specifying the column containing the text to be evaluated. |

## ðŸ§  Example Usage
```python
from dataflow.operators.general_text import LangkitSampleEvaluator
from dataflow.utils.storage import FileStorage

class LangkitSampleEvaluatorTest():
    def __init__(self):
        self.storage = FileStorage(
            first_entry_file_name="./dataflow/example/GeneralTextPipeline/eval_test_input.jsonl",
            cache_path="./cache",
            file_name_prefix="dataflow_cache_step",
            cache_type="jsonl",
        )
        
        self.evaluator = LangkitSampleEvaluator()
        
    def forward(self):
        self.evaluator.run(
            storage=self.storage.step(),
            input_key='text'
        )

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test = LangkitSampleEvaluatorTest()
    test.forward()
```

### ðŸ“Š Result Analysis

**Sample 1 (Normal Descriptive Text):**
- Flesch Reading Ease: 72.53 (appropriate difficulty, suitable for general readers)
- Contains diverse vocabulary with 8 difficult words
- Readability level suitable for middle school students

**Sample 2 (Highly Repetitive Text):**
- Flesch Reading Ease: 116.14 (very easy to read)
- All words are monosyllabic with 0 difficult words
- But high repetition reduces text quality

**Sample 3 (Complex Academic Text):**
- Flesch Reading Ease: -23.94 (very difficult to read)
- Contains 32 difficult words and 30 polysyllabic words
- Automated Readability Index: 27.63 (requires professional-level education)
