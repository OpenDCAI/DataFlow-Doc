## ðŸ“˜ Overview
The `PerplexityFilter` is an operator designed to filter data based on perplexity scores. It calculates the perplexity of text using a Hugging Face model, where lower scores generally indicate higher fluency and quality. This operator is useful for cleaning datasets by removing low-quality or nonsensical text entries.

## `__init__`
```python
def __init__(self, min_score: float = 10.0, max_score: float = 500.0, model_name: str = 'gpt2', device='cuda')
```
| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **min_score** | float | 10.0 | The minimum perplexity score for a record to be kept. |
| **max_score** | float | 500.0 | The maximum perplexity score for a record to be kept. |
| **model_name** | str | 'gpt2' | The name or path of the Hugging Face model to use for scoring. |
| **device** | str | 'cuda' | The device on which the model will run (e.g., 'cuda' or 'cpu'). |

## `run`
```python
def run(self, storage: DataFlowStorage, input_key: str, output_key: str = 'PerplexityScore')
```
| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **storage** | DataFlowStorage | Required | The DataFlow storage instance for reading and writing data. |
| **input_key** | str | Required | The name of the input column containing the text to be scored. |
| **output_key** | str | "PerplexityScore" | The name of the new column that will store the calculated perplexity score. |

## ðŸ§  Example Usage
```python

```
#### ðŸ§¾ Default Output Format
The operator adds a new column (specified by `output_key`) with the perplexity score to the existing data and filters the rows based on `min_score` and `max_score`.

| Field | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| *original_fields* | any | The original fields from the input data. |
| PerplexityScore | float | The calculated perplexity score for the text in the `input_key` column. |

**Example Input:**
```json
{
"text": "This is a fluent and well-formed sentence."
}
```
**Example Output (if it passes the filter):**
```json
{
"text": "This is a fluent and well-formed sentence.",
"PerplexityScore": 42.5
}
```
